## About this Modpack

Absurd is a Minecraft modpack designed specifically for PojavLauncher, aiming to improve performance and provide a smooth gaming experience on Fabric.

## About PojavLauncher

PojavLauncher is a flexible, fast, and open-source Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android and iOS.

## Why I made this modpack

Due to the significant differences between ARM and x86 architectures, developers need to adapt APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for compatibility. This modpack optimizes the experience for ARM-based devices.

## Graphics Compatibility

Graphics translation is not 100% perfectâ€”some errors and bugs may still occur. Additionally, certain renderers may not support all mods.

## Java and Performance

PojavLauncher uses JRE (Java Runtime Environment) builds for AArch32/64 (ARM32/64), which allow Minecraft to run on mobile devices. However, performance on ARM processors differs from x86 processors, requiring custom mod configurations to achieve the best experience.

Required Settings

To ensure everything works correctly, set the renderer to LTW (OpenGL ES 3) and use Java 17.
